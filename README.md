# Popularity Indexes
There are various Programming Language Popularity Indexes, among which PYPL and TIOBE indexes are the most prominently used. PYPL(Popularity of Programming Language Index) measures how often Language tutorials are googled while TIOBE index measures the sheer quantity of search engine hits. The results provided by these indexes are not reliable as their parameters are not based on industry deployed projects. This project focuses on parameters which will be more reliable.
